<p>In 2009 two brothers named Ian and Neill Briggs founded the Briggs Automotive Company (BAC). </p>

<p>Before making any cars, the brothers consulted multiple companies on design and engineering<br> projects before deciding to make it comlpletly on their own.</p>

<p>The result of their work was very lightweight, single seater, open cockpit, street legal racecar.</p>

<p>The first Mono was made in 2011, and its first sighting was at an auto show in Stuttgart, Germany</p>

<p> the first generation of Monos origionaly had a 2.3L four cylinder, heavily modified by Cosworth.<br>
    the engine made 280 hp at 7,700rpm</p>

<p>Even though the engine only made around 280 hp, the total weight of the Mono was almost half a ton!<br>
    This enabled the car to launch itself from 0-100kph in under 3 seconds!</p>

<p>In 2019, BAC unveiled the Mono R. It is a higher performance version of the standard Mono.<br>
    The Mono R had 38 more hp and weighed 25 kg less.<br>
    It also increased the size of the engine to 2.5L, to allow it to rev higher and output more torque.</p>

<p>In 2022, Adam Christodoulou performed a lap time on the Red Bull Ring of 1: 32.96, which is<br>
    four seconds faster than the Porsche 911 GT3 RS</p>

<h3>Some Reasons Why I Like the BAC Mono</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>Even though it only prosuces around 300hp, It can still pack a serious punch due to its incredible weight!</li>
    <li>Beacuse BAC is a very small company, whe you order one, you can talk directly with the owners of the company, <br>
        also allowing you to suggest special cosmetic designs that you wouldnt be able to get in a regular luxury vehicle.</li>
    <li>Beacuse of BAC not making very many cars, the only people that truly know about the Mono or BAC as a company <br>
        are car enthusiasts or people that were watching Top Gear in the early 2010s</b></li>
</ul>
